    # <tt>dissonance(audio)</tt>
    #
    # This algorithm calculates the sensory dissonance (to distinguish
    # from musical or theoretical  dissonance)  of  an  audio  signal.
    # Sensory dissonance measures perceptual roughness  of  the  sound
    # and is based on the roughness of its spectral peaks.  Given  the
    # spectral peaks, the  algorithm  estimates  total  dissonance  by
    # summing up the normalized dissonance values  for  each  pair  of
    # peaks. These values are computed using dissonance curves,  which
    # define dissonace between two spectral peaks according  to  their
    # frequency and amplitude relations.  The  dissonance  curves  are
    # based on perceptual experiments conducted in [1]. Exceptions are
    # thrown when the size of the input vectors are not  equal  or  if
    # input frequencies are not ordered ascendantly
    #
